# Introduction

This set of notes shows some examples of using \LaTeX\ with R markdown.

The idea is to give examples which help if you are reasonably comfortable
with R markdown but want *some* of the customisation of using LaTeX without
having to become a LaTeX guru \footnote{Although if you do get proficient
in this stuff you may well get the guru title}. The code that generates the 
.pdf output is in the .Rmd file in this repo.

# What is \LaTeX? {#Sec_WhatIsLaTex}

Well if you have been 'Knit'ing to PDF inside RStudio you have been using 
LaTeX all the time. You may have already used things like \\newpage to 
tidy up a document. The \\newpage is actually a LaTeX command which is being
detected by Knitr as it processes the document.

LaTeX is used extensively in academia particularly in any subject that requires
a lot of maths notation. It is a different way of thinking about documents. You 
write your document in plain text and add in the various commands that format the 
document into something that looks nice. It means you can produce a PDF document
with formulas and figures and tables without ever going near Word. But it is
not for everyone. If you need a WYSIWYG editor then this is not for you.

In the past you would need to use a LaTeX editor of some kind (e.g. the cross platform open source program [TeXMaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/)). With the advent of RStudio and 
R Markdown (*which I assume you are at least partly familiar with*) you can now
write well formatted PDF documents with very little knowledge of LaTeX. 

This set of notes will show you how you can extend your documents by using
a small amount of LaTeX code in the text portion of your .Rmd R markdown 
document. 

NOTE: if you go down this route you can't flip back to HTML output. The Knitr
package will get a bit upset and probably miss out some of the LaTeX commands. It will look like it has worked, there will just be missing bits (give it a try ...)

## Some History {#SubSec_LatexHistory}

LaTeX is actually a typesetting programming language and was developed
by Leslie Lamport in 1983. See this link for a more detailed
description [LaTeX History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX#History).

It is a layer of code over the top of the typesetting language \TeX which
was developed by the famous computer scientist Donald Knuth in 1978. See
this link for more details [Tex History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX)

# Useful YouTube links

+ [LaTeX Tutorial 1 - Creating a LaTeX Document](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoDv0qhyysQ)

The above link is the start of a very useful series of videos
by Michelle Krummel.

# Font Sizes

\begin{Large}
Some Large (with a capital 'L') text
\end{Large}

\begin{large}
Some large text
\end{large}

\begin{normalsize}
Some normalsize text
\end{normalsize}

Compare this default R markdown line to the above 'normalsize' text.

\begin{small}
Some small text which runs over several 
lines of text and allows us to put in more information
in a smaller space. Which can be useful if the information
is very dense.
\end{small}

\begin{footnotesize}
This is footnotesize. Useful size for tables and other hard to fit in things.
\end{footnotesize}

# Size and Position of Figures

This can be really awkward as \LaTeX\ often thinks *it* knows best. 

The web is full of stuff that doesn't work for output to .pdf documents. 
Here are some commands to try for controlling the position and size of figures.

## Size Using out.width and out.height

The technique I use all the time is to import the picture into the document
with an R chunk. Inside the R chunk you use:

+ knitr::include_graphics()

You add options to the chunk header.

```{}
{r, out.width='18cm',out.height='12cm'}
```

This gives:

```{r, out.width='18cm',out.height='12cm'}
image.path <- here('images','GitWorkflow.png')
knitr::include_graphics(path = image.path)
```

The 18 cm seems to work for an A4 page which is 21 cm wide. You can adjust
the height to suit your image.

Let's half the size.

```{}
{r, out.width='9cm',out.height='6cm'}
```

This gives:

```{r, out.width='9cm',out.height='6cm'}
image.path <- here('images','GitWorkflow.png')
knitr::include_graphics(path = image.path)
```

### Sometimes even this doesn't work
The problem with the above is that sometimes even this doesn't work and it 
can be *very* frustrating. The out.width and out.height options are just ignored. My best guess
at this is that the original image size is to big *or* too small for the resizing
to work. This is hinted at in this web post https://github.com/yihui/knitr/issues/1477.

The way I fix this is usually to resize the image to something that looks about right on an 
A4 page on my Macbook screen and then screen grab it using the Mac's Cmd-Shift-4 sequence. I have 
this set to capture as .pdf but the default is .png. This seems to give me something that will
resize most of the time. Tedious eh (best Canadian accent).

\newpage
## Centre the Image

Now we can try to centre the image. The next two attempts *__don't__* work
for me despite lots of the internet telling you they will.

<!-- MAJOR MAJOR PAIN -->
<!-- \begin{center} -->

```{r, out.width='9cm',out.height='6cm'}
image.path <- here('images','GitWorkflow.png')
knitr::include_graphics(path = image.path)
```

<!-- \end{center} -->

<!-- NOTE the four backticks to get this to render correctly -->


I had to update my TexLive installation on 2024-11-11
This seems to have caused a major screw up using the following code, i.e. 
knitr::include_graphics(path = image.path) within "\\begin{center}\\end{center}"
causing 'Knit' to fail completely.


Directly in the text part of the R markdown.

```{}
\begin{center}
\include_graphics('images/GitWorkflow.png')
\end{center}
```

This doesn't even produce the plot!

## Using fig.align="center"

This technique *does* work. Add this into the chunk header.

```{}
{r, out.width='9cm',out.height='6cm',fig.align="center"}
```

This gives:

```{r, out.width='9cm',out.height='6cm',fig.align="center"}
image.path <- here('images','GitWorkflow.png')
knitr::include_graphics(path = image.path)
```

*Here is a link to a constantly referenced article on the web about this stuff.
Note that it is biased towards HTML output*
[ZevRoss Article](https://www.zevross.com/blog/2017/06/19/tips-and-tricks-for-working-with-images-and-figures-in-r-markdown-documents/#use-dpi-to-change-the-resolution-of-images-and-figures)

---

So let's add a 'Large' title and caption

\begin{Large}
\begin{center}
Git Workflow
\end{center}
\end{Large}

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.height='8cm', out.width='12cm'}
image.path <- here('images','GitWorkflow.png')
knitr::include_graphics(path = image.path)
```

Figure1: The above diagram shows a typical Git workflow using
a cloud based Git provider (e.g. Bitbucket or Github) as the central
repository for the team's work.

\newpage
## Multiple figures

I came across this link https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/figures-side.html
which shows a technique for putting figures side by side. It works!

```{}
{r, figures-side, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%"}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
plot(cars)
plot(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars, pch = 19)

```

Using our .png images like this:

```{r, figures-side,fig.show="hold", out.width="50%"}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))

image.path <- here('images','GitWorkflow.png')
knitr::include_graphics(path = image.path)

image.path <- here('images','GitWorkflow_2.png')
knitr::include_graphics(path = image.path)
```

Be warned that this seems quite fragile and I was able to easily break it by using dissimilar
image sizes or trying to add a caption with fig.cap="abc".

# Centred Text

```{}
\begin{center}
Some centred text on a line
\end{center}
```

Gives this:

\begin{center}
Some centred text on a line
\end{center}

# Maths and Greek Symbols

This link, https://rpruim.github.io/s341/S19/from-class/MathinRmd.html, gives a 
good overview of getting standard maths notation into your R markdown document.

Here is an example:

```{}

\begin{align*}
a & = b \\
X &\sim {\sf Norm}(10, 3) \\
5 & \le 10
\end{align*}


```

which will produce this text:

\begin{align*}
a & = b \\
X &\sim {\sf Norm}(10, 3) \\
5 & \le 10
\end{align*}

# Quarto Equation Numbering

This is really quite unpleasant.

* \url{https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/2275}

```{}
<!-- even though we are using {flalign} we still need to use a & single line or &\\ multiple line to force -->
<!-- the left justification -->
<!-- See these links -->
<!-- https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/2275 -->
<!-- https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html#equations -->

<!-- Equation numbering: -->
<!-- The key is this line \numberwithin{equation}{subsection} in the  -->
<!-- include-in-header: top yaml bit -->
```


```{}
        include-in-header: 
            text: \addtokomafont{disposition}{\rmfamily}
                  \usepackage{amsmath} 
                  \numberwithin{equation}{section} #{section|subsection}
                  \usepackage{xurl}
                  \usepackage{typearea}
```


# Internal Section Links

This is how to reference an internal section

From this link (answered May 19 '14 at 9:11 by hoijui:)

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2822089/how-to-link-to-part-of-the-same-document-in-markdown

1. Create the anchor
2. Reference the anchor

* Create the anchor

You do this by adding a link name in curly brackets to the header you will be referencing.

```{r}
# My Useful Section {#Sec_MyUsefulBit}
```


* Reference the anchor

Somewhere in your *body text* use the normal syntax for a link 

```{}
[link name](link)
```

so for example 

```{}

See the section on [What is LaTex](#Sec_WhatIsLaTex)

```

See the section on [What is LaTex](#Sec_WhatIsLaTex)

This also works for sub sections, i.e. H2 headers

Here is the markdown:

```{}
See this paragraph [History of LaTex](#SubSec_LatexHistory) for more details.
```

which will give this output in your document.

See this paragraph [History of LaTex](#SubSec_LatexHistory) for more details.

# Rotating Pages

Make sure the .Rmd YAML header has this in it:

```{}
header-includes:
      - \usepackage{pdflscape}
```

Then before a chunk something like this:

```{}
\newpage
\begin{landscape}
```

With a chunk specification like:
```{}
{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}

titleStr <- 'Percent Marked Monitoring Time (Filtered Data)'
subtitleStr <- 'Kids BIT'

p <- Generate_Marking_PC_MonTime(plot_mpcmt_filtered
                                 ,titleStr = titleStr
                                 ,subtitleStr = subtitleStr)

print(p)
```

Followed by a closing section after the chunk:

```{}
\end{landscape}
```

NOTE: the ```fig.align='center'``` is critical and some web references say that
this does not work with ```knitr::include_graphics()```, although I have not confirmed that.
